Goal:
-make interface
-modular
-customize able via config file
-For highly unorganized data like this, after operation at least you should show error list. And options should be available on error shots, thus..
	-shot entity is needed for organizing data. Tree structure is best. External library? For now, dict of dict implemented as tree is enough?
- Because Nuke's Python is outdated. Let's seperate script. One dedicated for running within nuke and print query data. Main one intercept and read these outputs and operate on them.

Descriptor[Done]
- workflow should be defined! No customization! Don't give option to user!
- Seperated public method, then call private method..
